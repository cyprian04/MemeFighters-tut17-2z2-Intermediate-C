# MemeFighters Simulation Fight
Welcome to MemeFighters, simulation where two teams of meme warriors engage in a fierce battle. 
Only one team can emerge victorious in this lighthearted but intense showdown.

## Learning Objectives
This project was created with the goal of learning key concepts in C++, including:

- **Inheritance:** Explore the hierarchy of meme warriors using inheritance to represent commonalities among them.
- **Polymorphism:** Implement polymorphic behavior to allow meme warriors to exhibit unique actions based on their individual characteristics.
- **Unique Pointers:** Utilize unique pointers for efficient memory management, ensuring proper ownership and destruction of meme warriors.
- **Abstract Classes:** Create abstract classes to define the interfaces and common functionalities shared by meme warriors.
